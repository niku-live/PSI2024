# Lecture 1

## What was discussed

All course information can be found at [MIF VMA Software engineering course](https://emokymai.vu.lt/course/view.php?id=1291)

### Teams setup

All assignnments will be done in teams of 4-5 people size.
Teams will be responsible for developing an application to solved one of selected problems.

### Week Evaluation Process

Each week team makes a demo of what changed during last week (their application, their code, their task distribution and etc.) and then evaluates each other. Each team member has to rationalize why they are giving this amount of points to other team member. You can split points by half, not more. Every team member has X points when evaluating, where X = team members count + 1.  

Evaluation example: I am in the team of 4 people, we present, and I can give out 5 points, so I decide to give 2 to myself, because I worked on a lot of features and helped others, 1.5 to a colleague that implementing dependency injection, 1 to a person who created couple new classes and structs and 0.5 to a person who joined the discussions, tried to implement something but failed to commit. Every person in the team votes and in the end we have a sum next to each person where lecturer then enters these numbers into evaluation sheet document.

### Deadline Process

If team (or a person) is late to pass through the assignment then maximum mark is lowered by 20% each week.  

If team (or a person) is early to pass through the assignment then maximum mark is increased by 5% each week (but no more than 10%).  

Evaluation process is as follows:
- Let's say week number 7 comes, deadline for the first assignment, team wants to pass it
- Teams makes a demo of an application. Each deadline is like a sprint from Scrum process, so for each demo team must present an application that has a fully working functionality. Of course application will be fully complete only by last deadline, but even for intermediate deadlines team must present an application with at least part of working functionalities (treat this as alpha/beta/final versions of your application)
- Lecturer after the demo checks if all the requirements are fullfiled, can also ask questions to specific people to check the validity of the knowledge (and affect the end mark that a person is getting). Not all of requirements must be implemented (at least 75% is expected), it will depend on your application (how well it is implemented and etc.)
- After that, all the points are summarized up from week 1 to now, and person who collected most points gets maximum, and the rest accordingly (if second best person is very close to first best person in points then both get maximum evaluation)
- Lecturer also can say after the demo, that for this application you can get at most 70% (or any other X%) of the maximum mark, because application is missing this and that. You can disagree and then come back next week with fixes that were mentioned.
