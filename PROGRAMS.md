General topic: improving cognitive skills using gamification.
Concrete suggestions:
1. Practice in order to improve your memory. *I.e. allow user to create mnemonics for specific concepts and then quiz on these mnemonics.*
2. Practice to improve your reflexes. *I.e. think of [https://play.typeracer.com/](https://play.typeracer.com/) to improve the typing speed or [https://aimtrainer.io/](https://aimtrainer.io/) to improve mouse aiming skills.*
3. Practice to improve your reading speed. *I.e. present the user some practical quick reading tips, then give a limited amount of time to read some text, finally give a quiz on that text.*
